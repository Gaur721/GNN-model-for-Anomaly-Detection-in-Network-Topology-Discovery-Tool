# GNN-model-for-Anomaly-Detection-in-Network-Topology-Discovery-Tool
I designed a GNN model using Pytorch to analyze SCADA network data, including SNMP and routing tables, for anomaly detection. The model detects unauthorized devices and unusual patterns, leveraging graph-based representations of network topologies. Optimized for accuracy and scalability in real-time monitoring scenarios.
